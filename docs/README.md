### User Interaction
Users interact with my program by inputting an aduio (.mp3) file, I've included one just in case. \
*Personally, I recommend experimenting with other songs.* \
*Please feel free to play around with the script, I recommend disabling the drawTreble funciton for better results.*

### Tasks
Your program will show a 2D scene similar to the example at https://harviu.github.io/WebGL-Example/html/soldier.html
* Your scene should contain at least 3 layers of hierarchy. (3 points)
* Each hierarchy should contain at least one transformation. (3 points)
* Each of Translation, Scaling, and Rotation should be correctly implemented and used at least once. (1 point)
* Transformations are bound to user input and interaction. (1 point)
* Creativity and aesthetics. (1 point)
